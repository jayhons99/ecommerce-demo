# ecommerce-demo
###
An ecommerce project that uses React, Tailwind, and React-Icons to design the UI. Routing is done via React Router and uses React's Context API to keep track of state.
It leverages Stripe to handle payments and AWS Lambda to host a serverless backend environment to handle API calls to Stripe.

# Additional Details
This project was built using John Smilga's [React Course](https://www.udemy.com/course/react-tutorial-and-projects-course/) for general look as well as to use his API to fetch products. 
I put my own spin on it by using Typescript instead of Javascript as well as implementing most of the cart and checkout functionality myself. The repository for the lambda function 
can be found [here](https://github.com/jayhons99/stripe-backend).
